# Project Title: Add row using js

## Introduction:

Well. i have been working around with this kind of task. so i thought, why not make it more intresting?
At first i thought, well lets do it in a gaming style like arcade pixel games. but it was having a little dtyling issue with Table, so i didnt use it, instead i thought lets do something nostalgic.
first i found a framework that can make interface like "DOS" ;) , but no, dos isnt interactive . i also had xp, and windows 7.. but i liked the simplicity of 98. here we are. :) i hope you will like it.

**So in conclusion I have done the job , and i did some cool stuff cause sure i can B-) **
